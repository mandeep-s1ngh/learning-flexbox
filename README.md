# **Learning CSS Flexbox**

## <ins>Summary</ins>

This is a web page built using CSS Flexbox following Brad Traversy's 'Flexbox Crash Course 2022' Youtube [video](https://youtu.be/3YW65K6LcIA).

The purpose of this website was to allow me to build up a better understanding of flexbox and it's fundamentals so I have a better grounding for whenever I decide to learn a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.
